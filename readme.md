This is an example of how to create virtual training datasets for FRC. 

The 2024 folder contains `field_test.blend` which is a blender file containing the field.

The `test_path.traj` is a path drawn in [Choreo](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo) which you can easily replace with your own path with. 

From there you can run the Colab Notebook (BlenderProc Test.ipynb)

This is largely just a dump of some test scripts I put together for my personal experiments and is in no way a fully documented project. If you're interested give it a shot and file issues/PRs as you see fit.
